This is a project about security
I decide this topic because the security of is the first importante thing in a compagny the comapgny must be secure 
In the project you will use multiple language:NodeJS,Jascript,html,css etc
and you are going to install mutiple dependecies using npm 
in server side we have mongodb and is framework mongoose and in frontEnd you have we will use ejs technologie css and boostrap etc
in the project you are using also the dotenv dependencie to ignore to put the secure file like a passworld and username is security
in the project we are using Resfull technologie which allows us to create a router for our project 
we have a home page 
in the home page we two part
register
and login 
and logout
if you want login inside the project you shoud have type a new user name and a passport 
that user name and passport will be save in a database 
after that you will be able login in 
first you need to register your self in the application after that you will be alows to login only if your user and passpor are saving in the database else
you will get the erro message 
and you can not register your self with same email id two time because the email is can not be duplicated 
and after login you can go back to the Hoge by clicking logout button 
this application show the first level of securty 
the the passworld will be save like a normale name or number any one in the compagny if he access the database he will be able to see all the passport of the the users 
and the compagny is in dangerieous problem in the case of Hacker probleme the can descript easy the compagny data 
then for the compagny be is security the is more level of secrity that software can use 
like hashing security or OAuth2.0 than will allow the securty of the compagny
and for more level see you on next topicc
